# TODO
This project is a work in progress project and that is why it is missing some code:

## Testing
There is **zero** test implemented.  

## UI
Actually is not missing. This code shows only *wireframes* and focus on the background architecure. It is ready to receive any other format of design because it is implemented in the most simplistic way.
